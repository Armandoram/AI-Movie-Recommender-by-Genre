This was my capstone project for my university.
It was made in a Jupyer Notebook and uploaded through google colab, once the csv file is uploaded then you run the code and a drop down list of genres will appear.
Selecting the genre and pressing the accompanied button will select a random movie for you to watch.
Further down includes some code that works as visualizations such as graphs and charts based on the amount of movies per genres.
